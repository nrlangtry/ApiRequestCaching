# ApiRequestCaching
This solution shows caching techniques for API requests.
- API - Exposes request endpoints for various caching techniques
- Data - A static database & repository classes wrapping the database calls & cache the data.
- Shared - Interfaces & other shared resources across projects

I will add a console app that will kick-off threads to call the API requests & add metrics to show performance differences.
